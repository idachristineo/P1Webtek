               <p><b>Our client:</b> Sjøbris Restaurant and Bar, owned by Fredriksten festningshotell drift AS</p>
               <p><b>Contact person:</b> Marianne Olsen, hotel manager </p>
               <p> Our client is Sjøbris Restaurant and Bar, which is a seasonal based restaurant owned by Fredriksten festningshotell drift AS. The restaurant is located on the pier in Halden, Norway. Marianne Olsen is the hotel manager, and our contact person for this web site. Sjøbris is open from May to August, and has its main focus on sustainable and local seafood. They want to replace the existing website with a new one, and need some more functions than the current one possess. </p>
               
               <p>Most of the inquiries regarding both the content and the desirable design for the web site will be handled by one of our group members, Sunniva. She is the owner of Sjøbris, and has taken on the responsibility of marketing the restaurant in social media and through the web site.</p>
             
            </section>
            
            <section id="purpose">
            	<h2>What is the purpose of the web site?</h2>
            	<p> TThe purpose of Sjøbris’ new web site is two folded. It should maintain the restaurant’s relationship with existing guests while at the same time attracting new ones. The web page should provide essential practical information that is easily available to customers, such as opening hours, menu and location. Furthermore, it is desirable to implement a solution where guests can manage the whole process of booking a table themselves. Today the booking system consists of a phone number and a book where the waiters write down the reservations, which sometimes can be quite laborious. The new booking system should give guests instant feedback. </p>
				<p> Sjøbris already has a web page, <a href="http://sjobris.no/" target="_blank" style="color:black;"> www.sjobris.no </a>, but would like a new one that presents their identity and core values more clearly. They are not happy with the current appearance of the web page either. It is important that the core values of Sjøbris are communicated through the web page, namely sustainable and locally produced food. To bring up the fact that Sjøbris does not offer scampi and tuna in its sushi due to ethical reasons is important. Guests are sometimes disappointed that the restaurant does not provide these commodities, so it would be nice if they were aware of this before they arrive the restaurant. It is an option to include the history of sushi in Norway, as Sjøbris’ menu is a fusion between Norwegian and Japanese food, but this is not an absolute necessity.</p>
                
				<p> In short: the web site should give the potential guests the desire to choose Sjøbris for their lunch, cocktails or dinner. They should immediately wish to go to pier where the restaurant is located and order some delicious seafood from the menu. Occasionally, Sjøbris hosts’ concerts and other cultural events that should be possible to promote through their web page. It should communicate that Sjøbris offers take-away. An option is also to offer the guests the opportunity to order take-away directly from the web page, but this probably depends on the cost of implementing an existing system. The site should also communicate that the restaurant functions as a bar at night time. </p>

            <section id="targetGroups">
            <h2>Target groups</h2>
            <p>The main group of guests is rather wealthy, quality conscious people between 35 and 60 years. Most of them are local residents in Halden. The associated Fredriksten hotel promotes Sjøbris and sometimes hands out discount vouchers to their guests, which attracts tourists to the restaurant. Thus, there are two main targets groups: local residents that want to book a table, look at the menu and examine the opening hours, and tourists that wants to check out the restaurant offers in the area. There is also a third target group, namely qualified restaurant staff looking for a job. As Sjøbris is a seasonal based restaurant, good staff is often hard to obtain. The target groups are well acquainted with computers, locating information on the internet and online booking.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section id="organization">
            <h2>Organization of the website</h2>
            <p>The client needs the following pages:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li>A main page, with easy access to the subpages and applications. It should also include some crucial information (like opening hours) readily at hand, as well as nice pictures of the interior and the food, all while underlining the focus on sustainable seafood.</li>
            	<li>A booking page, where the guests can easily book, reschedule and delete bookings. The client must pay for the implementation of an existing booking system.  </li>
            	<li>A menu page, where the menu is displayed to the client, complete with pictures and allergy information. It could also include a bar menu.</li>
            	<li>An “about” page, which features the history of the restaurant and the owners, some info on the restaurants stance on sustainable food as well as the location. </li>
            	<li>A job application page, where potential workers can review open positions and submit their resumées and applications. </li>
                <li>
                A gallery page for the menu</li>
            	<li>A location page, which offers directions and a map to the restaurant for people who are not known in the area and tourists. </li>
                <li>A calendar page, which should be an overview of upcoming events, such as concerts etc. </li>
            	<li>A link page, with links to Fredriksten Hotel and other attractions/business partners in the area.</li>
            </ul>

			<section id="specifics">
            <h2>Specifics</h2>
            <p>It is desirable that the design of Sjøbris web page is as clean as possible, with the color palette consisting of the same shade of blue as in the logo. It can also have a grey or an orange subcolor, but not necessarily. Simple, clean and straight lines are prefered. We imagine that the two main user groups are most accustomed to this type of clean layout, and thus associate it with quality. The food is simple, organic and of high quality, and the web design should seek to resemble these characteristics. The appearance of the page is equally as important as the content. The appearance should seek to emphasize the content, although the food and location is mainly what should be highlighted. The already existing web page can be used as a starting point or as a mean of reference, but the layout there is somewhat messy. More white space, and cleaner backgrounds is prefered, not like the “rough paper surface” presented in the grey part of the existing page.</p>
            </section>
			
			<section id="location">
            <h2>Location</h2>
            <p> The site will still be published at the domain the restaurant is currently using, <a href="http://sjobris.no/" target="_blank" style="color:black;"> www.sjobris.no </a> </p>
            <p>When this project is done and the page is delivered to Sjøbris, it will be Sunnivas job to maintain it, as it is a part of her job as the web marketing manager. Today the client is using umbraco.com which is a Content Managment System (CMS). They want to abandon CMS because it is too expensive. If the web site is not to our or the client's satisfaction in the end of the project period, the web site will only be published on NTNU’s servers. </p>

            <section id="technicalDifficulties">
            <h2>Technical difficulties</h2>
            <p>There are three main technical difficulties that we need to address. This list is in prioritized order. </p>
            <ol>
            	<li><b>Pictures:</b> The client want to make us of several pictures that presents their food in a good and tempting manner. To ensure that the web page does not take too long to load and thus become frustrating to use, we have to be aware of the size, resolution and number of pictures.  </li>
            	<li><b>Booking:</b> The booking system has to be effective for both the customer and the employees that handles it. There should be no wrongdoing like double bookings. We will most likely advise the client to pay for an already existing booking software that we will implement into the web page. Due to the time scope of the project and the budget of the client, we will probably show this solution as a screenshot or graphical presentation. </li>
            	<li><b>Take away:</b> The client is also considering to have an online take away ordering system, this challenge can also be solved by implementing existing software. Due to the time scope of this project and the budget of the client, we will probably show this solution as a screenshot or graphical presentation. </li>
            </ol>
