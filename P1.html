               <p> Our client is Sjøbris Restaurant and Bar, which is a seasonal based restaurant owned by Fredriksten festningshotell drift AS. The restaurant is located on the pier in Halden, Norway. Marianne Olsen is the hotel manager, and our contact person for this web site. Sjøbris is open from May to August, and has its main focus on sustainable and local seafood. They want to replace the existing website with a new one, and need some more functions than the current one possess.

            	<h2>What is the purpose of the web site?</h2>
            	<p> The purpose of Sjøbris’ new web site is two folded. It should maintain the restaurant’s relationship with existing guests while at the same time attracting new ones. The web page should provide essential practical information that is easily available to customers, such as opening hours, menu and location. Furthermore, it is desirable to implement a solution where guests can manage the whole process of booking a table themselves. Today the booking system consists of a phone number and a book where the waiters write down the reservations, which sometimes can be quite laborious. The new booking system should give guests instant feedback. 
				</p>
				<p> Sjøbris already has a web page, <a href="www.sjobris.no" target="_blank"> www.sjobris.no </a>, but would like a new one that presents their identity and core values more clearly. They are not happy with the current appearance of the web page either. It is important that the core values of Sjøbris are communicated through the web page, namely sustainable and locally produced food. To bring up the fact that Sjøbris does not offer scampi and tuna in its sushi due to ethical reasons is important. Guests are sometimes disappointed that the restaurant does not provide these commodities, so it would be nice if they were aware of this before they arrive the restaurant. It is an option to include the history of sushi in Norway, as Sjøbris’ menu is a fusion between Norwegian and Japanese food, but this is not an absolute necessity.
